# Basic-Portfolio

For this portfolio assignment, I wanted to add a bit more of my personality and give the layout a more unique, memorable but simple style.

I added a few extra elements like separating out the projects by type, including a resume button, social media links, a status area in the contact form, adding a skills section and questions, favicon and answers section to the about page.

To Do:

I did not spend time writing content yet. I do not have much right now. So I would add descriptions and images to all of the sections I made.

In addition, I need to build out the different portfolio pages which I imagine would span the whole screen.

Ideally this site would be responsive. I could not figure out how to get the left panel to stop being static after a certain dimesnion. Maybe we will learn more this week.

Another thing I would do is go back and make things more SEO optimized with the tags Ron showed us.

Nice to Haves:

If I were to change anything, it would be giving the page some illustrations in the background. Ideally this would have a space like theme.

Inspiration:

After looking through lots of different portfolio sites, my inspiration for this design was: http://becca.li/index.html

I tried to make it my own though!
